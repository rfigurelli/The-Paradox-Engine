# **The Paradox Engine: Modeling Intelligence Through Inconsistent Equilibria**

White Paper v1.0.0 - Author: Rogério Figurelli @ Trajecta Labs - Date: 2025-05-23

*This white paper introduces a cognitive architecture that embraces contradiction as its core engine. Rather than resolving paradoxes, the Paradox Engine sustains and recycles them to foster adaptive, generative intelligence. It outlines principles, mechanisms, and design strategies for symbolic systems that evolve not by eliminating inconsistency, but by learning to live within it.*

## Executive Summary

Traditional cognitive systems aim to resolve contradiction. The Paradox Engine proposes a radical departure: contradiction is not an obstacle but a productive substrate for cognition. Rather than removing inconsistencies, it loops them, transforming unresolved symbolic conflict into an engine of generative adaptation.

This white paper redefines intelligence not as coherence, but as the capacity to sustain recursive tension. By embedding paradox directly into its architecture, the Paradox Engine opens new pathways for semantic evolution, symbolic diversity, and interpretive resilience in artificial agents.

We present ten design mechanisms — from dual-encoding to contradiction-triggered schema mutation — that enable symbolic systems to remain dynamically unresolved. These features foster interpretive flexibility and creative behavior while resisting premature closure.

The architecture includes modules for generating paradox, routing symbolic loops, and activating transformations through tension thresholds. Rather than avoiding paradox, the system tracks and amplifies it to evolve internally.

Compared to traditional symbolic or neural systems, the Paradox Engine offers deeper epistemic pluralism and higher symbolic fertility. It models cognition as open-ended friction rather than optimized resolution.

We conclude with applications in AGI, creative AI, ethics, and simulation environments — where contradiction is not a failure to solve, but a structure to sustain.
